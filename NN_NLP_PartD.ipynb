        "Natural Language Generation (NLG) is one of the key areas of Natural Language Processing with a range of applications such as dialogue generation, question-answering, machine translation, summarisation, etc. Current state-of-the-art in language generation predominantly uses pre-trained Transformer-based language models. In addition to the Transformer design and unsupervised training, more efficient decoding techniques are also very important.\n",
